    <h3 id="introduction">1. Introduction to Vireo II</h3>
    <p>Vireo II is a rewrite of the Vireo I kernel, which was a very unstable and poorly thought through kernel. Vireo I lacked a good architecture and good coding practices, and was compiled using the system compiler.
        The new Vireo II should improve this quite a bit. It's rewritten, though not entirely from scratch: some code from the Vireo I kernel will be 'upcycled' into the new Vireo II kernel.  
        <br><br><br>

        <strong><i>Vireo I vs Vireo II</i></strong>
        <br>Vireo I was very unstable and annoying to work with, because of the lack of planning beforehand. Furthermore, Vireo I used the GCC system compiler instead of a cross-compiler.
        It had trouble with the keyboard and mouse, PATAPI and more. Some ISRs didn't seem to work. Not all of these problems were caused by the GCC system compiler, but they are annoying bugs and problems nevertheless.
        Vireo II will improve on Vireo I in a few key ways:<br>
        <br>- <b>Vireo II will be easier to work with;</b> thanks to a more dynamic makefile, more documentation, better function names and handling, etc.
        <br>- <b>Vireo II will be better suited as an OS;</b> thanks to a new cross-compiler and better handling of its working environment.
        <br>- <b>5 years more experience;</b> which means, or should mean, better source code and a better kernel.   
        <br><br><br>

        <strong><i>About Vireo I</i></strong>
        <br>The project started on September 14th 2014 as a 16-bit kernel. After a long period of time, in which nothing was done, the project was renewed. This time 
        by making a 32-bit kernel with a GUI (the GUI was never made). Back then it had no name. Later on, however, it got the name Bird OS. In 2018 the Bird OS name was split up with a name for the GUI (Bluebird) and the kernel (Vireo). 
        Halfway through 2019, the creator saw how awful the kernel was and thought it would be best to start all over... again.
        <br><br>This is not to say, however, that Vireo I can't be used for anything. It may be a bad and picky kernel, which really wants some things to be there (for example, it needs a FAT32 formatted PATA harddrive with a BIRDOS directory on it in order to work).
        However, you may be succesful at doing something with it. It cannot load ELF binaries, but it is able to single task flat binaries. This, unfortunately, does require some extra code to be written for it to find and execute the binary. There are functions to find files and execute a flat binary somewhere in the kernel, which can be used for this purpose.
         There's only one catch: there is no documentation for Vireo I.

        <br><br><br>
        <strong><i>About this manual</i></strong>
        <br>This manual is updated, as necessary, alongside the development of the kernel. This manual may be trusted above any other, possibly conflicting, sources; with an exception to the current source code, which is considered as more authoritative.
        <br><br>
    </p>
    
    <h3 id="building">2. Building the kernel</h3>
    <p>The kernel is built using a GCC cross-compiler and NASM, using the utillity called <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/m44rtn/xenops">Xenops</a> to increase the build number with every build, for the next build. Currently, the kernel is built using an i686-elf
        cross-compiler using GCC v8.3.0. A cross-compiler is not included with the source, but you can use <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler">this guide</a> to easily build one yourself.
        <br><br>
        Use <code>make all</code> to build the entire kernel.<br>
        Use <code>make iso</code> to make an ISO image using that kernel.<br>
        <br>
        Not every option in the makefile is (or will be) documented, but you can take a look at the makefile in the GitHub repository to see all the options.
        <br><br>
    </p>

    <h3 id="debugging">3. Debugging the kernel</h3>
    <p>Virtualbox is used to test and debug the kernel. Using the makefile, the <code>make run</code> command will run any virtual machine called "Bird OS" (without "), and will automatically launch the Virtualbox debug console.
        You can use this console to debug the kernel. A few useful commands of the Virtualbox debug console are listed in <i>table 3.0</i>. <br><br>
        <table style="width: 100%">
            <caption>Table 3.0 - Useful Virtualbox debug console commands</caption>

            <tr>

                <td>Unassemble 16-bit/32-bit code at the address specified.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <br>
    </p>

    <h3 id="exit_codes">4. Exit codes</h3>
    <p>
        Exit codes in the kernel are one byte long (<code>unsigned char</code>), meaning a maximum of 256 error codes, and indicate if the function has executed correctly. When an error occurs a function will return a non-zero exit code which indicates the type of error.
        Although every module may have its own exit codes, the kernel provides some global exit codes. <br>

        <br>The first sixteen error codes (0 - 15) are reserved for global use. Modules shouldn't use the values of these exit codes to indicate a different 'state' than described in <i>table 5.0</i>.<br><br>
        Not all functions return exit codes, in fact initialization functions are the the most likely to return exit codes. It is possible that non-initialization functions will return an exit code.<br><br>
        
        Module specific exit codes can be found in the source code.
        <br><br>
       
       <table style="width: 100%">
        <caption>Table 4.0 - Global exit codes</caption>
        <colgroup>
            <col width="33%">

        <tr>
            <td>EXIT_CODE_GLOBAL_SUCCESS</td>

            <td>Means the function was executed correctly without any error</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>EXIT_CODE_GLOBAL_GENERAL_FAIL</td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>Means the function failed, but with no specific error</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>EXIT_CODE_GLOBAL_NOT_IMPLEMENTED</td>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>Means the function (or part of) is not yet implemented</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><i>&lt;reserved&gt;</i></td>
            <td>3 - 9</td>
            <td>Reserved for future use</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>EXIT_CODE_GLOBAL_UNSUPPORTED</td>
            <td>10</td>
            <td>Means the function has stumbled on something that is not supported</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><i>&lt;reserved&gt;</i></td>
            <td>11-15</td>
            <td>Reserved for future use</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <i>EXIT_CODE_GLOBAL_UNSUPPORTED</i> is used to indicate that something is unsupported. This could be anything. An example of this would be for the function 
    <code>uint8_t strdigit_toInt(char digit)</code>, where the variable digit is not a string-like digit (1-9) but instead is a letter (A-Z, a-z). Thus, it's not able
    to convert the string like digit to an integer (i.e. the value provided is not supported by the function).

    </p>

    <h3 id="drivers">5. Drivers</h3>
    <p>
        The kernel has some necessary built-in drivers to load additional drivers at start-up. These drivers are always built and linked with the kernel. Most drivers shouldn't be built-in. Only drivers
        that need to be present for driver loading are. This means the only built-in drivers are filesystem and storage device drivers. Any other drivers should be loaded by the kernel
        on boot-up. Built-in drivers are listed in table 5.0.
        
        <table style="width: 100%">
            <caption>Table 5.0 - Built-in kernel drivers</caption>
            <colgroup>
                <col width="25%">
                <col width="75%">
            </colgroup>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Description</th>
            <tr>
                <td>IDEController (<code >IDEController.c</code> and <code>IDEController.h</code>)</td>
                <td>This module handles IDE devices (harddrives and cdrom drives)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>FAT Filesystem (<code >FAT.c</code> and <code>FAT.h</code>)</td>
                <td>This module handles the FAT filesystem</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        Drivers used by the kernel make use of an identifier and information structure. The structure in question looks like this:<br><br>
        <code style="display:block; background-color: #EAEAEA; border-radius: 5px; width: 15%; padding: 15px;">
            struct DRIVER<br>
            {<br>
                &nbsp;uint32_t sign1;<br>
                &nbsp;uint8_t sign2[8];<br>
                &nbsp;uint32_t type;<br>
                &nbsp;uint32_t interface;<br>
            } __attribute__((packed));
        </code>
        <br>

        For a driver to be accepted (and found) by the kernel, the structure needs to be filled with specific values. The values are only used for initialization of the drivers. 
        The first part of the structure is the signature (values listed in table 5.1), which is necessary for the kernel to know for certain the driver IS a driver and compatible with the kernel. If this part is not right, 
        the kernel will ignore the driver. The next part is the type and it states what kind of devices the driver is for, this is further explained below table 5.1. Last but not least, the interface. The value of <code>interface</code> 
        is assumed to be the pointer to the main handler function of the driver. This handler function is expected to be the only function to handle the communications with and requests from the kernel.

        <table style="width: 20%">

            <colgroup>
                <col width="10%">
                <col width="10%">
            </colgroup>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Value</th>
            <tr>
                <td><code>sign1</code></td>
                <td>0xB14D05</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><code>sign2</code></td>
                <td>"VIREODRV" (without quotes)</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        
        //TODO type stuff
        <br>
        <b>How the driver type works</b>
        <br>
        The driver type in the DRIVER struct works different for every device type. Currently, the kernel supports
        only PCI devices. This will change over time though. The information in the lower part (bits 0 through 23) of the type is 
        completely dependent on the value in bits 24 through 31. Bits 24 through 31 will be referred to as <code>driver_type</code>.
        <br><br>

        <table style="width: 20%">
            <caption>Table 5.2 - Possible values in <code>driver_type</code></caption>
            <colgroup>

                <col width="10%">
            </colgroup>
            <th>Value</th>
            <th>Description</th>
            <tr>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>The driver is for PCI devices</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <br>
        PCI device drivers currently only store the supported device subclass (at bit 0) and class (at bit 8).
        <br>
        <br>

        In the future there will probably a driver folder, no specification on that yet.
