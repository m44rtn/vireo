# Vireo

Vireo is a simple mono-tasking operating system for the x86 (i686+) cpu architecture. There is no real goal for this project, since Vireo is more about the experience of making the system. For example, security is not really considered in all parts of Vireo.

## Repository organization
Each part of Vireo has its own directory. For example, the kernel lives in the kernel directory and the syslib lives in the syslib directory. Each part has its own README, detailing more about the part and how to build it.

## License
All parts of Vireo are MIT licensed.
