    <h3 id="introduction">1. Introduction to Vireo II</h3>
    <p>Vireo II is a rewrite of the Vireo I kernel, which was a very unstable and poorly thought through kernel. Vireo I lacked a good architecture and good coding practices, and was compiled using the system compiler.
        The new Vireo II should improve this quite a bit. It's rewritten, though not entirely from scratch: some code from the Vireo I kernel will be 'upcycled' into the new Vireo II kernel.  
        <br><br><br>

        <strong><i>Vireo I vs Vireo II</i></strong>
        <br>Vireo I was very unstable and annoying to work with, because of the lack of planning beforehand. Furthermore, Vireo I used the GCC system compiler instead of a cross-compiler.
        It had trouble with the keyboard and mouse, PATAPI and more. Some ISRs didn't seem to work. Not all of these problems were caused by the GCC system compiler, but they are annoying bugs and problems nevertheless.
        Vireo II will improve on Vireo I in a few key ways:<br>
        <br>- <b>Vireo II will be easier to work with;</b> thanks to a more dynamic makefile, more documentation, better function names and handling, etc.
        <br>- <b>Vireo II will be better suited as an OS;</b> thanks to a new cross-compiler and better handling of its working environment.
        <br>- <b>5 years more experience;</b> which means, or should mean, better source code and a better kernel.   
        <br><br><br>

        <strong><i>About Vireo I</i></strong>
        <br>The project started on September 14th 2014 as a 16-bit kernel. After a long period of time, in which nothing was done, the project was renewed. This time 
        by making a 32-bit kernel with a GUI (the GUI was never made). Back then it had no name. Later on, however, it got the name Bird OS. In 2018 the Bird OS name was split up with a name for the GUI (Bluebird) and the kernel (Vireo). 
        Halfway through 2019, the creator saw how awful the kernel was and thought it would be best to start all over... again.
        <br><br>This is not to say, however, that Vireo I can't be used for anything. It may be a bad and picky kernel, which really wants some things to be there (for example, it needs a FAT32 formatted PATA harddrive with a BIRDOS directory on it in order to work).
        However, you may be succesful at doing something with it. It cannot load ELF binaries, but it is able to single task flat binaries. This, unfortunately, does require some extra code to be written for it to find and execute the binary. There are functions to find files and execute a flat binary somewhere in the kernel, which can be used for this purpose.
         There's only one catch: there is no documentation for Vireo I.

        <br><br><br>
        <strong><i>About this manual</i></strong>
        <br>This manual is updated, as necessary, alongside the development of the kernel. This manual may be trusted above any other, possibly conflicting, sources; with an exception to the current source code, which is considered as more authoritative.
        <br><br>
    </p>
    
    <h3 id="building">2. Building the kernel</h3>
    <p>The kernel is built using a GCC cross-compiler and NASM, using the utillity called <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/m44rtn/xenops">Xenops</a> to increase the build number with every build, for the next build. Currently, the kernel is built using an i686-elf
        cross-compiler using GCC v8.3.0. A cross-compiler is not included with the source source, but you can use <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler">this guide</a> to easily build one yourself.
        <br><br>
        Use <code>make all</code> to build the entire kernel.<br>
        Use <code>make iso</code> to make an ISO image using that kernel.<br>
        <br>
        Not every option in the makefile is (or will be) documented, but you can take a look at the makefile in the GitHub repository to see all the options.
        <br><br>
    </p>

    <h3 id="debugging">3. Debugging the kernel</h3>
    <p>Virtualbox is used to test and debug the kernel. Using the makefile, the <code>make run</code> command will run any virtual machine called "Bird OS" (without "), and will automatically launch the Virtualbox debug console.
        You can use this console to debug the kernel. A few useful commands are listed in <i>table 3.0</i>. <br><br>

            </tr>
        </table>
        <br>
    </p>

    <h3 id="conventions">4. Coding conventions</h3>
    <p>
        Vireo II is written in the C89 C and the NASM standard. These conventions exist for consistancy, not to claim a 
        particular style is better. The 3 main guidelines are:<br><br>
        1. Match the style of the surrounding code and documentation.<br>
        2. Keep code simple, fast and (at least semi-)secure.<br>
        
        <br>
        It is possible for these guidelines to change in the future.

        <br><br>
        <b>Note to self:</b> try to be consistent.
        <br><br>
        Any comments or feedback about the conventions in use by the code or listed above are very welcome! :)
        <br><br>
    </p>

    <h3 id="exit_codes">5. Exit codes</h3>
    <p>
        Exit codes in the kernel are one byte long (<code>unsigned char</code>), meaning a maximum of 256 error codes, and indicate if the function has executed correctly. When an error occurs a function will return a non-zero exit code which indicates the type of error.
        Although every module may have its own exit codes, the kernel provides some global exit codes. <br>

        <br>The first sixteen error codes (0 - 15) are reserved for global use. Modules shouldn't use the values of these exit codes to indicate a different 'state' than described in <i>table 5.0</i>.<br><br>
        Not all functions return exit codes, in fact initialization functions are the the most likely to return exit codes. It is possible that non-initialization functions will return an exit code.<br><br>
        
        Module specific exit codes can be found at their <a href="#funclist">function listing</a>.
        <br><br>
       
       <table style="width: 100%">

            <td>Means the function was executed correctly without any error</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>EXIT_CODE_GLOBAL_GENERAL_FAIL</td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>Means the function failed, but with no specific error</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><i>&lt;reserved&gt;</i></td>
            <td>2 - 15</td>
            <td>Reserved for future use</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h3 id="init_funcs">6. Initialization functions</h3>
    <p>
        Most modules are started by an initialization function, used to set-up its working environment and internal variables. 
        In order for the modules to be 'independent' from the main kernel files, there are some conventions (here we go again). YAY!
        <br><br>
        Most of these conventions are specifically written down for the creator, because he messed up the previous attempt (aka Vireo I). However, every module should abide to them.
        <br><br>

        Initialization functions are called by the kernel because it thinks it will need them. The initialization function should then set-up everything it needs. Meaning: internal variables, its working environment, necessarry hardware, etc. However, it's not necessary to keep everything in the init function. It is expected, however, that any additional functions used by the init function (not intended to be used by other modules) to be static and defined inside the source file ('*.c'). The init function should always return an exit code.
        
        <br><br>
    </p>


    <h3 id="funclist">A0 - Function listing</h3>
    <p>
        In every module (aka source code file) of the kernel, there are two kinds of functions: static (internal) and public functions. Static functions are not available to other modules and are inaccessible to them, they are not documented in the reference manual. Documentation for the static functions can be found in the code where necessary, as code comments.
        <br><br>Public functions are available to every module in the kernel, and are made to be as error free as possible. 

        <br><br><br>

        <strong><i>Global functions - global_functions</i></strong>
        <br><i>global_functions</i> is a module which contains a few basic functions, which makes some tasks just that tiny bit easier. Pun intended.
        <br><br><strong>Note:</strong> functions in this module DO NOT have a file name prefix (e.g. global_functions_[function name]).
