# Vireo kernel

This is the kernel used by the BirdOS operating system. Currently this is an x86 kernel, but it may be ported to x86_64 in the future.

## Running
If you would like to run or build the kernel, take a look at the [wiki](https://nothing.here/yet). However, it is currently not very interesting to look test.

## Goals of the OS/project
The operating system is made for learning purposes. BirdOS will have a GUI and it will (hopefully) be faster than Windows.
The project's ultimate goal would be to run on an x86 UEFI powered 2-in-1 tablet/laptop thingy.

## Contributions
I will currently not accept contributions to this repository. In the future when the kernel is 'finished' and one of the above named goals is reached (except the faster than windows one), I will.
