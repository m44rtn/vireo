# Vireo kernel

This is the kernel used by the BirdOS operating system. Currently this is an x86 kernel, but it may be ported to x86_64 in the future. 

Feedback is always welcome.

### Running
If you would like to run or build the kernel, take a look at the [wiki](https://nothing.here/yet). However, it is currently not very interesting to look test.

### Goals of the OS/project
The operating system is made for learning purposes. BirdOS will have a GUI and it will (hopefully) be faster than Windows.
The project's ultimate goal would be to run on an x86 UEFI powered 2-in-1 tablet/laptop thingy.
