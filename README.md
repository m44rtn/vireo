# Vireo kernel

This is the kernel used by the BirdOS operating system. Currently this a very unstable x86 kernel. It's written in C.

You may find some information in the Wiki, including some information on how to build the source.

The current documentation (together with the kernel itself) is horrible, but this will be changed in the future.
